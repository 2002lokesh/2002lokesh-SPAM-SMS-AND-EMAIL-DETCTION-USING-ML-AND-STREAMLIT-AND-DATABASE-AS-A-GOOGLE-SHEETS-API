# Spam SMS and Email Detection using Machine Learning and Streamlit

## Overview
This project implements a spam detection system for both SMS messages and emails using machine learning techniques. Leveraging the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised learning algorithms, this system classifies incoming messages as either spam or legitimate. The project provides a user-friendly interface developed with Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the model and see its predictions in real-time.

## Features
- **Spam Detection**: The system employs a trained machine learning model to accurately classify messages as spam or not spam.
- **Streamlit Interface**: The user interface is built using Streamlit, making it intuitive and accessible for users to interact with the model.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Users can input SMS messages or emails into the interface and immediately see the model's classification.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for the development of the project.
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn library is utilized for building and training the classification model.
- **Streamlit**: Framework used to create the interactive web application.
- **Google Sheets API**: A database is implemented using Google Sheets API for storing and managing training data.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/2002lokesh/2002lokesh-SPAM-SMS-AND-EMAIL-DETCTION-USING-ML-AND-STREAMLIT-AND-DATABASE-AS-A-GOOGLE-SHEETS-API/edit/main`
2. **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the Application**: `streamlit run app.py`
4. **Interact with the Interface**: Access the application through your web browser and input SMS messages or emails to test the spam detection model.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a labeled dataset containing examples of both spam and legitimate messages for training the machine learning model. The dataset used can be found at [Kaggle Spam sms data set].

## Contributions
Contributions to the project are welcome! Feel free to submit issues, feature requests, or pull requests to help improve the functionality and performance of the spam detection system.
